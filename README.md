# Notes
I did not officially take this course, I watched the publically available lectures and assignments. I want to thank [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.stanford.edu/), and [The Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) for making this course publically available, allow me and other to gain a deep understanding of NLP with deep learning. I encourage anyone who has an interest to follow the links below.

# CS224n-Natural-Language-Processing-with-Deep-Learning
Natural language processing (NLP) is a crucial part of artificial intelligence (AI), modeling how people share information. In recent years, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance on many NLP tasks. In this course, students gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge neural networks for NLP.

## Content
#### What is this course about?

Natural language processing (NLP) or computational linguistics is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in language: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual agents, medical reports, etc. In recent years, deep learning (or neural network) approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for NLP. Through lectures, assignments and a final project, students will learn the necessary skills to design, implement, and understand their own neural network models. As piloted last year, CS224n will be taught using PyTorch this year.
